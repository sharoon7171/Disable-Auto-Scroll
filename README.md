# Disable Auto Scroll Chrome Extension

## Overview

The Disable Auto Scroll extension for Google Chrome provides users with the ability to toggle on/off the auto-scroll functionality triggered by middle-mouse clicks. This extension is particularly useful for users who find the auto-scroll feature disruptive or accidentally trigger it frequently.

## Features

- **Toggle Auto-Scroll**: Easily enable or disable the auto-scroll functionality with a simple switch in the extension popup.
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preference (enabled/disabled) is saved and persists across browser sessions.
- **Non-Intrusive**: Works silently in the background without affecting other browser functionalities.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on browser performance.

## How It Works

When enabled, the extension prevents the default auto-scroll behavior triggered by middle-mouse clicks. It does this by intercepting middle-mouse click events and stopping their propagation when auto-scroll would normally be activated.

## Use Cases

1. **Precision Scrolling**: For users who prefer to use the scroll wheel or trackpad for more controlled scrolling.
2. **Avoiding Accidental Triggers**: Helpful for users with mice that have sensitive middle buttons, preventing unintended auto-scrolling.
3. **Web Development**: Web developers can use this to test their sites without the auto-scroll feature interfering.
4. **Reading Long Articles**: Allows users to middle-click on links to open them in new tabs without triggering auto-scroll on the current page.
